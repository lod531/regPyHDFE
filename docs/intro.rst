Introduction
============
This is a beautiful wrapper for PyHDFE. A more in depth introduction to be added here.

Motivation
**********
Stata sucks and We'd like to use Python. Most of all We'd like documentation that is not colloquial and actually informative.

Limitations
***********

Does not work with Weighting (yet).

Replication of Stata not _quite_ identical - within margin of floating point error.
